Mercury, a product designed to serve the Traders/ Clients for placing an efficient and accurate BUY/SELL call for the instrument. 
Here ``instrument" refers to Stock Name in the NSE market. 
The client/trader can choose to trade in Intra Day, BTST, Positional \& longterm. 
The Orders are placed via Kite API by Zerodha that provides real-time order placement towards Stock Exchange.
This product was initially a standalone application that had less scalability. Owing to this multiple advancements are added which are mentioned in the following. 
\par
The main aim is to modernize this application \& re-engineer to create a business-subscription model. In addition to this, Fast \& reliable service, Security compliance, and simple \& sleek UI are the major avenues to be developed. The product also involves customizing the trade calls based on preference, with options to customize every little thing, from web notification to user-based filters.

\subsubsection{Django}

For web development Django act as backend for website. Django Framework which is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design. Django provides various library support to configure the project to API mode, along with UI built, using jinja templating. Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, which renders web pages on the server-side. Django also has pre-built support for Postgres Database Engine. 

\subsubsection{PostgreSQL}
PostgreSQL is the primary database engine used in whole Algonauts system. PostgreSQL is a general-purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open-source database system. It is incorporated due to its performance \& ACID compliance which is an essential need for any modern web-based product. Postgres, provide \textit{User Defined Type} which is one of the most advance and essential feature while developing any modern application which makes database object-oriented. It also provides Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) support which always keeps data consistent.

\subsubsection{Redis \& Daphne}
\textbf{Redis} is an open-source, in-memory data store, used as a database cache and message broker. It forms channels and groups to cache the message. This creates Pub/Sub architecture, where messages are delivered on a subscription basis. Channel is mapped to a specific route, and groups are made to categorize the message and restrict message delivery for user subscription, making a robust dynamic business subscription model for the product.  \textbf{Daphne} is an HTTP,  and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP. Both \textbf{Daphne} and \textbf{Redis} extends asynchronous support for Django application. Mercury Product uses need Redis and Daphne for trade calls and stock price delivery asynchronously.

\subsubsection{VueJs}
Vue.js is an open-source modelâ€“view JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Its ecosystem includes a wide range of support libraries, that ease development and reduce the complexity of huge Single Page Application. It mostly focused on the view layer only and provides optimization for real-time single page application. Mercury is developed using Vue, extensive libraries makes product customize according to user needs.

\subsubsection{Designing and Developing  Database Backend}
Design the database design on business requirements, which was split into 3 parts, based on model interaction. 
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Frontend}: VueJs was used to make mercury web design, with \textit{axios} to make REST calls to the backend. Mercury UI has options to filter trade calls based on user preference and with on website trade using Kite Connect API. Web push library used to provide the push notification for calls, and call update
