\chapter{Conclusion}

I enjoyed working as a software developer intern, which improved my overall skills personally and professionally. I practiced the trending software developing practices, like Git version control and DevOps environment for project delivery which is based on agile methodology. 
The internship allowed me to explore real-world problems and coming out with a scalable solution, with grasping knowledge and revealing myself to new technologies and integrating it with our environment.
Even in environments of a pandemic where the team was separated, we came together through daily scrum calls, online meets, doing Work From Home(WFH).
I am thankful for the support and encouragement of Algonauts Pvt. Ltd. Team.
